- bio: I am a full stack web developer based in Slovenia. I've done extensive work
    with Django and Python and in the recent years I've been doing more and more frontend
    work. When I'm not coding, I'm immersed in music, having a good beer or playing
    board games. Ask me about Louis Armstrong and I won't shut up for days.

Having a hard time keeping track of where the modern JavaScript is going? Are you familiar only with jQuery and you want to know more? Or maybe you’re not familiar with JavaScript at all and want to learn it but you don’t know where to start? Then this talk is for you!

You’ll learn about modern JavaScript from a perspective of a Python developer. By the end of the talk you’ll know everything you need to know about the language, its ecosystem, and different tools and frameworks. You’ll be able to start using JavaScript more confidently and be familiar with different tools that are at your disposal.

We’ll go over all the things I wish I'd known when I first got started with JavaScript.:

- Basics of the language (types, operators, data structures, functions, modules, etc. as seen in ES6) and how they are similar to or different from Python.
- Overview of the commonly used development and build tools.
- Overview of the popular frontend frameworks.
- A look into the newest features of ES6 and Typescript.
- How to get started and make sense of everything with so much going on.
