abstract: A passing grade from an accessibility-checker is nice, but what's it really
  worth? Try actually navigating your site as a visually impaired user and you may
  be surprised what you hear. In this talk we'll use real examples and user anecdotes
  to build a website that sounds as good as it looks.

- bio: I've been in the web development business since 2003, when the web was still
    shiny and new and full of tables with rounded edges. I like fractals, tap dancing,
    and cats, so obviously you should listen to what I have to say.

In the past it was simpler and easier to think of building websites exclusively for desktop monitors capable of showing 1024x768 pixels, sitting on the desk of a non-impaired, English-speaking person. But today we need to embrace a much broader range of users. And one part of this is designing sites for the visually impaired.

There are automatic checkers that you can use to assess your site's accessibility. It will tell you that all your images need an alt tag, and that the H2 should come after the H1. This is a good start, but even if you dot all your i's and cross all your t's and get 100% pass, your site may be an unnavigable mess in practice.

In this talk we will look at and *listen to* real world examples of websites that either pass or fail the accessibility test. We will hear anecdotes from actual visually impaired users and discover how they navigate the web. And we will see that even though frameworks like Django can set us up for success, it's up to us as developers to follow through.
