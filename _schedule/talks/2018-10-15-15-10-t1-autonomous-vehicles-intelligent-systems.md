abstract: 'Autonomous vehicles have gotten a lot of press. But they''re only half
  the picture. For vehicles to be able to fully navigate a modern environment, they
  need to interact with that environment.

  This talk focuses on that interaction, and how Django is a part of it.'

What are the components in an autonomous vehicle? How do they work with other vehicles and an intelligent infrastructure? In this talk I will cover all the components involved in intelligent infrastructures and how Django is being used in current research.

Topics include
--------------------

* An overview of the infrastructure
    * Where are we right now?
    * What is the eventual goal?
    * How do we get there?
* OnBoard Units (OBUs)
* Road-Side Units (RSUs)
* Communications among components
    * Interoperability as a fundamental requirement
    * Message types
    * Communications standards
* Using Django
    * Upgrading equipment
    * Configuring equipment
    * Monitoring components
