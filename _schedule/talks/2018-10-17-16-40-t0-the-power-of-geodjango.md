abstract: Interested in mapping but don't know where to start? GeoDjango is Django's
  answer to handling your mapping needs. It extends Django models and uses PostGIS
  and GDAL to efficiently query geospatial data. This talk will demystify using GeoDjango
  to go from raw location data to viewing it on a map.

GeoDjango is Django's robust geographic Web framework to build GIS applications and handle geospatial data. It relies on PostGIS (PostgreSQL's database for geospatial objects) and the Python library GDAL. This talk will discuss how GeoDjango uses these to extend Django models to handle complex geometries and geographic queries. This talk is intended for software developers and those interested in mapping location data. There will be a short demonstration on how GeoDjango works with popular mapping frameworks like Leaflet and OpenStreetMaps. We will create a GeoDjango model, seed our PostGIS database using raw location data, and make a simple route and view so we can actually visualize some data on a Leaflet map. We will also discuss the difference between raster and vector data, geos geometries and geojson, and spatial reference systems.
