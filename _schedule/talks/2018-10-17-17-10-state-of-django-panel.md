Join us for a panel on the State of Django: the state of the Django codebase, but also the state of the Django community as represented by organizations like the Django Software Foundation, Django Girls, and DEFNA.

Moderated by Simon Willison, our panelists will discuss:

-  how we can continue to grow the Django community and create a welcoming space for beginners
- the priorities for the continued development and maturation of Django
- ways to improve Django events and bring them to new regions worldwide
- success stories from Django communities
- concrete steps toward better and more effective diversity and inclusion efforts

and much more. It's been a long time since we gathered leaders of the Django community on one stage to have an open-ended discussion about Django's present and future, and we hope you'll join us for this special event.
